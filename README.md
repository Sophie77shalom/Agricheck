# Agricheck: AI Powered Plant Doctor
## What it does:
Agricheck empowers small-scale farmers in Kenya by providing instant, accessible diagnosis of plant diseases. Using just a smartphone camera, a farmer can photograph a diseased leaf and receive an immediate AI-generated diagnosis and a list of simple, organic treatment solutions.

## How we built it:
Built a simple and intuitive web application using Streamlit for the frontend and Python for the backend. The core of the application is powered by the Google Gemini API. Designed a specialized prompt that turns the AI into an expert agronomist, capable of analyzing visual symptoms and generating context-aware advice for Kenyan farmers.
